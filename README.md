# Proxy Server
This project is a basic proxy server implemented in Python. It is designed to handle HTTP requests, forward them to target servers, receive the responses, and send them back to the clients.
## Features
- HTTP Request Handling: The server can receive and forward HTTP requests from clients, ensuring smooth communication between clients and target servers.
- Multithreading: The proxy server can handle multiple client connections at the same time, thanks to its multithreading capability, making it suitable for high traffic scenarios.
- Caching: Frequently requested resources are cached to improve response times and reduce the load on target servers.
- Logging: Client requests and other significant events are logged, providing useful insights for monitoring and debugging.
